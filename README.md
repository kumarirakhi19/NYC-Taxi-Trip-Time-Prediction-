ROC curves use a combination of the true positive rate (the proportion of positive examples predicted correctly, defined exactly as recall) and false positive rate (the proportion of negative examples predicted incorrectly) to build up a summary picture of the classification performance.
# Conclusion:

We are successfully able to implement both algorithms on the New York City Taxi Trip Duration dataset and able to draw certain conclusions from several inferences. After implementing both algorithms, we come across that DECISION TREE is better than LINEAR REGRESSION as it shows a slightly better accuracy than the latter one. This in turn helps to conclude that the DECISION TREE Model is more efficient and reliable in predicting the taxi trip duration as compared to LINEAR REGRESSION.
